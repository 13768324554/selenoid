== Selenoid under Windows

While we normally recommend to start Selenoid using http://aerokube.com/cm/latest[Configuration Manager], it is possible to start it under Windows manually. The main difference from Unix operating systems is how volumes are mounted. In any Windows paths back slashes (`\`) should be replaced by forward slashes (`/`) and drive letter should be lower cased. For example for `C:\Users\admin` we get `c:/Users/admin`. So assuming that configuration file is located at `C:\selenoid` a typical startup command can look like: 

    > docker run -d --name selenoid -v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 4444:4444 -v c:/selenoid:/etc/selenoid:ro aerokube/selenoid:latest-release
    
The most strange part here is `-v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` but this is how (with two forward slashes) Docker socket should be mounted in Docker for Windows.
