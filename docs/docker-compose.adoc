== Selenoid with Docker Compose

In order to start Selenoid with https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose] you need to enable bridge network mode:

```
version: '2'
services:
  selenoid:
    network_mode: bridge
    image: aerokube/selenoid
    volumes:
      - "$PWD:/etc/selenoid"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
    ports:
      - "4444:4444"
```
