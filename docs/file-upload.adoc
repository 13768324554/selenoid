== File Upload

Some tests require to upload files. This feature is supported in WebDriver protocol by sending zipped file contents to `/file` handle. However not all driver binaries support this feature. For example this is not implemented in http://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver[Geckodriver] or https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/master/cpp/iedriver[IEDriver]. When proxying requests **directly** to these drivers (i.e. when not using Docker) you need to start Selenoid with `-enable-file-upload` flag. In that case Selenoid will provide required API to tests. Firefox container images already include this parameter where needed.
