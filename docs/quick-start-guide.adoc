== Quick Start Guide
. If you work on Mac or Linux and have https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[Docker] installed type just one command:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
# docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /root:${HOME} aerokube/cm:latest-release selenoid start --tmpfs 128
----

. If you have Windows or have no Docker installed - download and run https://github.com/aerokube/cm[Configuration Manager] manually from https://github.com/aerokube/cm/releases/latest[releases] page.
+
**On Windows** - just download the binary with your browser or if you have https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell[Powershell] type:

    > curl -o cm.exe https://github.com/aerokube/cm/releases/download/1.1.2/cm_windows_amd64
    > ./cm.exe selenoid start

+
**On Linux:**

    $ curl -o cm https://github.com/aerokube/cm/releases/download/1.1.2/cm_linux_amd64
    $ chmod +x ./cm
    $ ./cm selenoid start

+
**On Mac:**

    $ curl -o cm https://github.com/aerokube/cm/releases/download/1.1.2/cm_darwin_amd64
    $ chmod +x ./cm
    $ ./cm selenoid start

. Run your tests against Selenoid like you do with regular Selenium hub:
+
----
http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
----

NOTE: Selenoid was created to be run in big Selenium clusters and thus has no built-in user interface. This is why trying to open an URL above in browser returns *404* and this is the expected behavior. The good news are - there is a standalone user interface. Refer to <<User Interface>> section for more details.
